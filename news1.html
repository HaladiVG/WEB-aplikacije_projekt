                <p class="description">A farmer said 14 of her ewes were hit by a train and killed after they were chased on to a railway line by a dog.</p>
                <p>Becki Spry, who has sheep near Tuddenham St Martin, near Ipswich, said the incident on 29 December was an "unnecessary loss of life".</p>
                <p>She has put up signs urging dog owners to keep their pets on a lead around livestock.</p>
                <p>Suffolk Police said it was investigating the incident and urged dog owners to be responsible.</p>
                <p>Ms Spry said she received a telephone call to say the ewes were on the railway line, and 11 of them were already dead when she got there.</p>
                <p>She said another two had to be put down due to injuries sustained and another died later.</p>
                <p>"It was clear they had been chased through the electric fence, up the bank and on to the railway line to get away from the dog," she said</p>
                <p>"It was very upsetting for us to see; they are our life, we put a lot of time, hours and care into them to make sure they are as well as they can be."</p>
                <p>Sgt Brian Calver, from the rural crime team at Suffolk Police, said: "When are we going to get this message across to people? Dog ownership comes with responsibility."</p>
                <p>He said the majority of dog owners using the Fynn Valley area were "decent law-abiding people who are doing the right thing".</p>
                <p>However, he said: "People need to understand they are walking a natural predator, they might not be aggressive, they might just want to chase and play, but you can't tell a sheep 'It's fine, that dog just wants to play with you.'</p>
                <p>"That is the owner's responsibility and all it takes is to keep the dog on a lead, it's not difficult."</p>
