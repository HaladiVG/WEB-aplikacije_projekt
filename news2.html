                <h2>Dog charity braced for £30,000 monthly vet bill</h2>

                <p class="description">A dog shelter is braced for a £30,000 monthly veterinary bill because of an "explosion" in unscrupulous breeders.</p>
                <p>Pontyclun-based Hope Rescue is expecting a traditional spike in unwanted animals post-Christmas.</p>
                <p>Such "fake strays" can have complex medical problems because of irresponsible sellers uninterested in animal welfare.</p>
                <p>The problem has been made worse by millions of people buying pandemic pets they no longer want.</p>
                <p>Hope Rescue staff said an "explosion in backyard breeders" helped create "a perfect storm".</p>
                <p>Most "fake strays" arriving at the Welsh charity's door now had medical problems, staff said.</p>
                <p>Dogs are known as fake strays when their owners pretend their pets are stray, in order for rescue centres to take them.</p>
                <p>In one morning the centre took in an American bulldog abandoned on Bwlch mountain, near Treorchy, Rhondda Cynon Taf, and two puppies dumped in a bin in Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan.</p>
                <p>The former had spinal problems, the latter skin trouble.</p>
                <p>The charity's Sara Rosser said January was always their busiest month.</p>
                <p>"More people get into financial difficulty and then struggle to pay their vets bills," she said.</p>
                <p>She added: "This year that's just going to be compounded even further by the issues we are already facing with dogs post-pandemic."</p>
                <p>More than three million UK homes have bought pets since the pandemic began, according to the Pet Food Manufacturers Association.</p>
                <p>Ms Rosser said: "Our vet bills at the moment are averaging around £20,000 a month, the majority of fake strays coming into us are coming in with medical problems, and that bill does add up."</p>
                <p>The Pontyclun centre has been running at capacity since last summer, with more than 130 dogs in their kennels.</p>
                <p>Ms Rosser said: "I can see us reaching £30,000 a month next year, the number of dogs requiring referrals, specialist treatment, these aren't just simple medical problems."</p>
                <p>The canine charity's Meg Williams said: "There was such a demand for dogs during Covid, that created a lot more people breeding who had not bred before, and don't necessarily understand the welfare issues."</p>
