                <h2>Dogs trained to sniff out high risk animal imports</h2>
                <p><time>2 January 2022</time></p>
                <p class="description">A new squad of dog detectors could help reduce the risk of exotic diseases arriving in Scotland.</p>
                <p>Funding from the Scottish government has led to the creation of a team of dogs who are specially trained to sniff out products of animal origin (PoAO).</p>
                <p>The aim is to identify items that carry a risk of diseases such as African swine fever or foot and mouth.</p>
                <p>The dogs will now be deployed at airports, ports and parcel hubs across Scotland.</p>
                <p>Figures provided by Border Force North show that in 2020, more than a tonne of products of animal origin were seized at ports and airports from people arriving in Scotland.</p>
                <p>Rural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon said: "The Scottish government and Border Force have worked closely to get the dogs operational in Scotland.</p>
                <p>"Alongside their handlers, they have taken part in a robust training regime and now that they have passed their assessments they can get to work and help us detect PoAO entering Scotland illegally."</p>
                <p>African swine fever does not affect humans but has led to the deaths of pigs around the world and can be spread through imports of pork and pork products.</p>
