                <h2>Charities face 'deluge' of unwanted lockdown dogs</h2>
                <p><time>1 January 2022</time></p>
                <p class="description">Northern Ireland animal charities have warned that they face a "deluge" of abandoned dogs as owners look to offload their "lockdown" pups.</p>
                <p>Illegal breeders are also surrendering dogs that have lost value now the coronavirus pandemic puppy boom has begun to wane, said the charities.</p>
                <p>Assisi Animal Sanctuary said puppy farms that had "scaled up" to meet demand were now dumping whole litters.</p>
                <p>Pet ownership soared in lockdown as more people sought canine companions.</p>
                <p>A survey by the non-profit Pet Food Manufacturers Association found 3.2 million UK households got a pet in the first 12 months of the pandemic.</p>
                <p>Now some of those dogs have ended up at shelters.</p>
                <p>Kennels at Assisi, Northern Ireland's largest independent animal charity, are now full.</p>
                <p>Young dogs born and raised in lockdown have begun to pour in to the sanctuary in Newtownards, County Down, said Assisi's chief executive Nigel Mason.</p>
                <p>These "juvenile delinquents" could be "four-figure" pedigrees but were never trained or socialised.</p>
                <p>"They've become young adults, with all the problems that brings," said Mr Mason.</p>
                <p>"They have some training issues but people don't want to deal with that or can't deal with it.</p>
                <p>"So they're bringing them to us because they think perhaps we can do a better job the second time around."</p>
                <p>In the two weeks leading up to Christmas, Almost Home in Moira, County Down, took in 56 dogs.</p>
                <p>The surrenders included two litters, one pregnant and four elderly dogs.</p>
